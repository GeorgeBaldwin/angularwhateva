Hello! This is a mess.


Originally speaking of my skills, this is clearly indictative of what I actually know. That being said, 
I have a lot to learn. There are no good SAAS practices here. There's a lot of google location business
but I couldn't figure out the time zones. That was a huge pain. But that isn't your fault. Doing timezone
stuff is just the nature of the game, and I could not hack it. 

1. If you click on the make this your prefferred state when you're on your preferred state's location it'll
remove the preferred state if you want to set the preferred state back to none.

2. I apologize for using your resources for this. I spent a lot of hours on it (you wouldn't guess it) and
I need to allocate my time elsewhere, continuing my job search. 

3. I am not withdrawing myself from any consideration, but this is where I'm at.

4. Thank you for your time, I appreciate the perspective that this exercise has given me. But hey, I used
Angular 7 for the first time! It's the same as 6 pretty much!
